They laid COCK ROBIN in his grave,<br />
And after that they sung a stave,<br />
And then they sent to fetch the sparrow<br />
Who kill'd him with the bow and arrow.<br />

Says the Judge to the Jury,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd have you take care,</span><br />
When a bird's life's at stake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its a serious affair.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The CUCKOO came in</span><br />
And began for to hollow<br />
As he dragg'd the poor Sparrow,<br />

When I found him, my Lord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was robbing a barn;</span><br />
He must live by thieving,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since nothing he'll earn.</span><br />
<br />
Says the SPARROW its false,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Both me and my wife,</span><br />
Are as honest as ever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You was in your life.</span><br />

A few grains of wheat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay at the barn door,</span><br />
We pick'd them all up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And did nothing more.</span><br />
<br />
Says MAG that has nothing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To do with the matter,</span><br />
I saw when you shot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And began for to chatter.</span><br />

I call'd DOCTOR PUSS<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To examine the wound,</span><br />
He knows what he saw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he'll tell, I'll be bound.</span><br />
<br />
Says PUSS I'm a doctor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So mind what I say,</span><br />
I happen'd to pass on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The very same day.</span><br />

I saw the poor Robin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sparrow had shot.</span><br />
He was quite dead and Cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So was not very hot.</span><br />
<br />
Says the DOG I ran out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From my kennel adjacent,</span><br />
Or I believe Doctor Puss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would have eaten his patient.</span><br />

However Cock Robin,<br />

And that is the reason<br />

Says the PIG I was hastily call'd from my stye,<br />
But just too late to see poor Robin die;<br />
I was ask'd by the Dog if I thought he was dead,<br />
Ah! both dead and cold was the answer I made.<br />
<br />
Says the ASS I was<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Coroner in this affair,</span><br />
We found Robin wounded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But could not tell where.</span><br />

We put on our spectacles,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those who had got 'em,</span><br />
And found that his wound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay just in his bottom.</span><br />
<br />
Says the DRAKE I was swimming<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Along with my Duck,</span><br />
The Sparrow sat on a tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Just by the brook.</span><br />

He took up his arrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And likewise his bow,</span><br />
And he shot, I believe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But I'm sure I don't know.</span><br />
<br />
Says the SWAN I was driving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along with the stream,</span><br />
Between sleep and awake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a sort of a dream.</span><br />

I saw the sharp arrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fly from the bow;</span><br />
I'm sure that I saw it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or else I dreamt so.</span><br />
<br />
Says the COCK I was standing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thinking no harm,</span><br />
When I saw Robin fall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I gave the alarm.</span><br />

I gave the alarm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With such a loud crow,</span><br />
If he'd been but asleep,<br />

Which he knew to be M<sup>r.</sup> Chanticlear's voice;<br />
When the Bat he beheld in pursuit of the Sparrow,<br />
But never saw either his bow or his arrow.<br />
<br />
Says the BAT I was constable,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sir, of the night,</span><br />
Though my candle was out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I've a pretty good sight.</span><br />

The Cock gave the alarm and my beast he took fright,<br />
And good reason I have to remember it well,<br />
For upon the hard ground on my bottom I fell!<br />
<br />
Says JUDGE HAWKE you are<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such a murdering elf,</span><br />
I think I shall kill you,<br />

<p>Odd spelling and word use was retained as printed. For example on the
first page it is "Judge Hawk" while on the final page it is "Judge Hawke."
Also, in the final stanza the usage of "eat" instead of our more modern
